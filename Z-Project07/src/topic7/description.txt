PROJECT 7: Streams

Consider the given Java interface Stream<E>. Note that Stream<E> inherits from the Java interface Iterable<E>, which means that the method Iterator<E> iterator() is inherited. 

a) Write an abstract class LazyStream<E>, which implements all the methods of the Stream<E> interface except Iterator<E> iterator(). "Lazy" means that the elements of the stream are not stored explicitly, they are computed only when a terminal operation (see below) is called.

There are two types of methods:

1. "Terminal Operations": matchAll, matchAny, countAll, countAny, get, find, reduce, toList
Their return type is not a stream. They can all be implemented by iterating through all the elements of the stream, using its iterator.

2. "Intermediate Operations": limit, skip, filter, map
Their return value is another stream. They can all be implemented by returning an element of an anonymous class which inherits from LazyStream. Here is a template:

@Override
public Stream<E> intermediateOperation(...) {
	:
	:
	return new LazyStream<E>() {
	
		@Override
		public Iterator<E> iterator() {
			:
			:
		}
	};
}

Note that the return type of map(Mapping<? super E, ? extends F> mapping) is a stream of a different type F. 

b) Write a class ArrayStream<E>, which inherits from LazyStream<E>. Its purpose is to construct a stream from an array, which is called "source" of the stream. Write a constructor

	public ArrayStream(E... array)

and the method Iterator<E> iterator().

c) Write a class SeededStream<E>, which inherits from LazyStream<E>. Its purpose is to construct a stream from a given initial element e (the "seed") and an update operation u, i.e. the elements of the stream are
	e, u(e), u(u(e)), u(u(u(e))), ...
There are two types of such streams. The first type has an infinite number of elements, whereas the second type contains only elements satisfying a given condition (as soon as an element not satisfying the condition is generated, the stream ends). Write corresponding constructors

	public SeededStream(E seed, Mapping<E, E> update)
	public SeededStream(E seed, Mapping<E, E> update, Predicate<E> condition)

and the method Iterator<E> iterator().

d) Write one or several example programs as a first test.

Test your implementation with JUnit. Corresponding JUnit test classes are given. Your solution needs to pass all the tests.

Document your classes and the given interfaces with JavaDoc.

DEADLINE: January 17th
